# WP-Database-Anti-Malware-SQL
I used these SQL queries in order to identify and remove malware added to some of my websites via SQL injection. If you ever run into a Wordpress Site redirect hack, feel free to use it in order to clean your database, also feel free to send your own list of malicious URLs/scripts, so we can get rid of this pest.

Long story short, I run a couple of wordpress websites as a part of several cultural projects I am a part of, earlier this week they were subject to a SQL injection that triggered a WP redirect to the attacker's spammy websites.

Indentifying the malicious code was easy, but removing it from more than 10,000 rows across 5 websites was a nightmare.

If anyone else has to go through this nightmare, feel free to add a list of the most common malocious links/scripts, so we can help whoever is unlucky enough to run into this ''hack''.

Special thanks to Jearel and Checo for helping me better understand what was going on.

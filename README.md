# WP-Database-Anti-Malware-SQL
I used these SQL queries in order to identify and remove malware via SQL injection. If you ever run into a Wordpress Site redirect hack feel free to use it in order to clean your database, also feel free to send your own list of malicious URLs, so we can get rid of this pest.

Long story short, I run a couple of wordpress websites as a part of several cultural projects I am a part of, earlier this week they were subject to a SQL injection that triggered WP redirect.

Indentifying the malicious code was easy, but removing it from more than 600 rows across 5 websites is a nightmare.

If anyone else has to go through this nightmare, feel free to add a list of the most common malocious links, so we can help whoever is unlucky enough to run into this ''hack''.

Special thanks to jearel and Checo for helping me understand what was going on.
